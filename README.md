## Overview
Stock movements are influenced by various factors, including social media sentiment. This project develops a machine learning model to predict stock price trends by analyzing user-generated content from social platforms like Twitter and Reddit. 

The project demonstrates:
- **Data Scraping**: Collecting stock-related discussions.
- **Preprocessing and Feature Extraction**: Cleaning data and extracting relevant features.
- **Prediction Modeling**: Using machine learning to forecast stock price movements.
