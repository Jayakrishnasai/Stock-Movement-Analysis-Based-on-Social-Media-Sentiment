# Stock-Movement-Analysis-Based-on-Social-Media-Sentiment

# Stock Movement Prediction

## Overview
Stock movements are influenced by various factors, including social media sentiment. This project develops a machine learning model to predict stock price trends by analyzing user-generated content from social platforms like Twitter and Reddit. 

The project demonstrates:
- **Data Scraping**: Collecting stock-related discussions.
- **Preprocessing and Feature Extraction**: Cleaning data and extracting relevant features.
- **Prediction Modeling**: Using machine learning to forecast stock price movements.

# HOW TO RUN PROJECT
To run your **Stock Movement Prediction** project with Twitter API data scraping (using a **bearer token**), here’s a step-by-step guide on how to proceed:

---

### **1. Setup Twitter API Access**
Before running the project, you need to set up your Twitter Developer credentials.

#### Steps to Get Twitter API Access:
1. Go to [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/).
2. Create a new **Twitter Developer App** and obtain:
   - **Bearer Token** (used for authentication in your scraping script).
3. Store the **Bearer Token** securely.

---

### **2. Install Required Dependencies**
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, especially for Twitter scraping. You can install them by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Your `requirements.txt` should include dependencies like:
```txt
tweepy
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
tensorflow
beautifulsoup4
matplotlib
seaborn
```

---

### **3. Configuration of Bearer Token**
To use the Twitter API, the **bearer token** must be added to your scraping script.

#### Example:
If your scraping script uses the **Tweepy** library, you should authenticate it using the bearer token.

```python
import tweepy

# Set your Twitter API Bearer Token
bearer_token = "YOUR_TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN"

# Authenticate to Twitter
client = tweepy.Client(bearer_token=bearer_token)

# Example: Scrape tweets related to stock movements
query = "stock market"
tweets = client.search_recent_tweets(query=query, max_results=100)

# Display the scraped tweets
for tweet in tweets.data:
    print(f"{tweet.text}")
```

Replace `"YOUR_TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN"` with your actual bearer token.

---

### **4. Running the Scraper**
After configuring the API and dependencies, follow these steps:

#### **4.1 Run the Scraping Script**
1. Navigate to the `scraper/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd scraper/
   ```

2. Run your scraping script (replace `<scraping_script.py>` with the actual script file name):
   ```bash
   python <scraping_script.py>
   ```

   The script will use the Twitter API to scrape tweets related to stock movements and save them as raw data.

---

### **5. Preprocessing Data**
Once you have the scraped data (usually in `.csv`, `.json`, or `.txt` format), you’ll need to preprocess it. 

#### **5.1 Run the Preprocessing Script**
Navigate to the `model/` directory and run the preprocessing script:
```bash
cd model/
python preprocess_data.py
```

This script will clean the data and extract useful features for training the model.

---

### **6. Model Training**
After preprocessing, the data is ready to be used for training the model.

#### **6.1 Run the Model Training Script**
Navigate to the `model/` directory and run the model training script:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will train the machine learning model to predict stock movements based on the sentiment or other features extracted from the scraped data.

---

### **7. Evaluation**
Once the model is trained, you can evaluate it using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

#### **7.1 Run the Model Evaluation Script**
If you have an evaluation script:
```bash
python evaluate_model.py
```

This will evaluate the model’s performance on the test data.

---

### **8. Jupyter Notebooks**
For easier visualization and understanding, you can run Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate each of the above steps (scraping, preprocessing, training, and evaluation).

#### **8.1 Run Jupyter Notebooks**
To launch Jupyter Notebooks, navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and run:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open a Jupyter notebook interface in your browser. You can open and run the notebooks to see the data scraping, preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps.

---

### **9. Final Thoughts**
- Make sure you replace placeholder values (like API keys, bearer tokens) with your actual credentials.
- Follow the steps in the order (scraping → preprocessing → model training → evaluation).
